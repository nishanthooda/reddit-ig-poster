# How it works

1. Python script uses Reddit API to fetch the top post from specified subreddit and downloads the associated image.
2. Selenium then opens Instagram on chrome, logs into the account, and then posts the image with specified caption.
3. A "rating" is generated in the caption based on how many upvotes the post had on reddit.
